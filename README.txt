YeeFilters is a downloadable program from the
intenet which allows the user to filter images
at will with 8 different filters. The filters
that come with YeeFilters are red, green, blue,
combine, extreme contrast, posterize, sepia,
two tone, and three tone filters.

When installing YeeFilters download the filter
files, cimpl file, and ui files into the same
folder then run the ui.

To use, simply select which filter you would 
like to apply to your image, then use the 
functions choose_file and load_image to select
your image from your computer. Once you have 
selected the image you want, the program will
return a copy of your image with the filter
applied.
